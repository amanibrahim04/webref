=> 48 WebIDL names found

Some of them may be type errors in specs (e.g. "int" does not exist, "Array" cannot be used on its own, etc.)
Also, please keep in mind that Reffy only knows about IDL terms defined in the specifications that were crawled **and** that do not have invalid IDL content.


## List of WebIDL names defined in more than one spec

- `Keyboard` defined in [Keyboard Lock](https://wicg.github.io/keyboard-lock/) and [Keyboard Map](https://wicg.github.io/keyboard-map/)

=> 93 missing references for links found in 38 specifications

Any link to an external document from within a specification should trigger the creation of a corresponding entry in the references section.

Note Reffy only reports on links to "well-known" specs and ignores links to non-usual specs (e.g. PDF documents, etc.) for now.

=> 9 inconsistent references for links found in 6 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
