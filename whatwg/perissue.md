% Specifications that define WebIDL content (WHATWG perspective)
% Reffy
% December 12, 2018

229 specifications were crawled in this report.


## Specifications that do not link to an Editor's Draft

- [Geolocation API Specification 2nd Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/)

=> 1 specification found

It is good practice to link to Editor's Draft for W3C specifications even for specifications published as Recommendations. Reffy (or rather the W3C API) could not find a link to an Editor's Draft for the specifications mentioned above.


## Specifications without normative dependencies

- [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 2 (CSS 2.2) Specification](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/)
- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://w3c.github.io/deviceorientation/spec-source-orientation.html)

=> 2 specifications found

Basically all specifications have normative dependencies on some other specification. Reffy could not find any normative dependencies for the specifications mentioned above, which seems strange.


## Specifications without WebIDL definitions

- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://w3c.github.io/deviceorientation/spec-source-orientation.html)

=> 1 specification found

Reffy was expecting to find IDL content in the specifications  listed here but could not extract any.


## Specifications without CSS definitions

- [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 2 (CSS 2.2) Specification](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/)

- [Selectors Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-3/)
- [Selectors Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors/)

=> 19 specifications found

Reffy was expecting to find CSS definitions in the specifications  listed here but could not extract any.


## Specifications with unexpected WebIDL definitions

- [CSS Animations Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/)
- [CSS Fonts Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/)
- [CSS Transitions Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/)
- [SVG Markers](https://svgwg.org/specs/markers/)

=> 4 specifications found

Reffy was not expecting to find IDL content in the specifications listed here but it did. Note that Reffy cannot deal with specifications that define IDL content and exist at different levels: only one level is flagged as defining the IDL. Other levels will incorrectly appear in this list as a consequence.


## Specifications with unexpected CSS definitions


=> 0 specification found


## List of specifications with invalid WebIDL content

- [CSS Layout API Level 1](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-layout-api-1/)
- [Font Metrics API Level 1](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/font-metrics-api/)

=> 2 specifications found

WebIDL continues to evolve. Reffy may incorrectly report as invalid perfectly valid WebIDL content if the specification uses bleeding-edge WebIDL features


## List of specifications with obsolete WebIDL constructs


=> 0 specification found


## Specifications that use WebIDL but do not reference the WebIDL spec

- [CORS and RFC1918](https://wicg.github.io/cors-rfc1918/)

=> 12 WebIDL names found

Some of them may be type errors in specs (e.g. "int" does not exist, "Array" cannot be used on its own, etc.)
Also, please keep in mind that Reffy only knows about IDL terms defined in the specifications that were crawled **and** that do not have invalid IDL content.

=> 206 inconsistent references for links found in 100 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
