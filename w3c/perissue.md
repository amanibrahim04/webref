=> 177 specifications found


## Specifications that do not link to an Editor's Draft

- [HTML Canvas 2D Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/)

=> 1 specification found

It is good practice to link to Editor's Draft for W3C specifications even for specifications published as Recommendations. Reffy (or rather the W3C API) could not find a link to an Editor's Draft for the specifications mentioned above.


## Specifications without normative dependencies


=> 0 specification found


## Specifications without WebIDL definitions


=> 0 specification found


## Specifications without CSS definitions

- [CSS Environment Variables Module Level 1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-env-1/)
- [CSS Shadow Parts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shadow-parts-1/)
- [CSS Transitions Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/)
- [CSS TV Profile 1.0](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-tv/)

=> 4 specifications found

Reffy was expecting to find CSS definitions in the specifications  listed here but could not extract any.


## Specifications with unexpected WebIDL definitions

- [CSS Animations Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/)
- [CSS Transitions Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/)

=> 2 specifications found

Reffy was not expecting to find IDL content in the specifications listed here but it did. Note that Reffy cannot deal with specifications that define IDL content and exist at different levels: only one level is flagged as defining the IDL. Other levels will incorrectly appear in this list as a consequence.

=> 74 WebIDL names found

Some of them may be type errors in specs (e.g. "int" does not exist, "Array" cannot be used on its own, etc.)
Also, please keep in mind that Reffy only knows about IDL terms defined in the specifications that were crawled **and** that do not have invalid IDL content.


## List of WebIDL names defined in more than one spec

- `Keyboard` defined in [Keyboard Lock](https://w3c.github.io/keyboard-lock/) and [Keyboard Map](https://wicg.github.io/keyboard-map/)

=> 1 WebIDL name found

"There can be only one"...

=> 77 missing references for links found in 34 specifications

Any link to an external document from within a specification should trigger the creation of a corresponding entry in the references section.

Note Reffy only reports on links to "well-known" specs and ignores links to non-usual specs (e.g. PDF documents, etc.) for now.

=> 12 inconsistent references for links found in 8 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
