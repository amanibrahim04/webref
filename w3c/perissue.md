% October 14, 2018

239 specifications were crawled in this report.


## Specifications that could not be rendered

Reffy could not fetch or render these specifications for some reason. This may happen when a network error occurred or when a specification uses an old version of ReSpec.

- [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/): `Error: Crawl took too long Error: Crawl took too long
    at Timeout._ [as _onTimeout] (/home/dom/github.com/reffy/src/cli/crawl-specs.js:338:29)
    at ontimeout (timers.js:498:11)
    at tryOnTimeout (timers.js:323:5)
    at Timer.listOnTimeout (timers.js:290:5)`

=> 1 specification found


## Specifications that do not link to an Editor's Draft

- [404 not found](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)
- [Geolocation API Specification 2nd Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/)
- [HTML Canvas 2D Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/)
- [Metadata API for Media Resources 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-api-1.0/)
- [Selectors API Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/)
- [The WebSocket API](https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/)
- [Web Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/)

=> 7 specifications found

It is good practice to link to Editor's Draft for W3C specifications even for specifications published as Recommendations. Reffy (or rather the W3C API) could not find a link to an Editor's Draft for the specifications mentioned above.


## Specifications without normative dependencies

- [404 not found](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)
- [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 2 (CSS 2.2) Specification](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/)
- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://w3c.github.io/deviceorientation/spec-source-orientation.html)
- [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html)

=> 4 specifications found

Basically all specifications have normative dependencies on some other specification. Reffy could not find any normative dependencies for the specifications mentioned above, which seems strange.


## Specifications without WebIDL definitions

- [404 not found](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)
- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://w3c.github.io/deviceorientation/spec-source-orientation.html)

=> 2 specifications found

Reffy was expecting to find IDL content in the specifications  listed here but could not extract any.

- [Selectors Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors)

=> 21 specifications found

Reffy was expecting to find CSS definitions in the specifications  listed here but could not extract any.


## Specifications with unexpected WebIDL definitions

- [CSS Animations Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/)
- [CSS Fonts Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/)
- [CSS Transitions Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions-2/)
- [SVG Markers](https://svgwg.org/specs/markers/)

=> 4 specifications found

Reffy was not expecting to find IDL content in the specifications listed here but it did. Note that Reffy cannot deal with specifications that define IDL content and exist at different levels: only one level is flagged as defining the IDL. Other levels will incorrectly appear in this list as a consequence.


## Specifications with unexpected CSS definitions


=> 0 specification found


## List of specifications with invalid WebIDL content

- [Font Metrics API Level 1](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/font-metrics-api/)
- [Metadata API for Media Resources 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-api-1.0/)
- [The WebSocket API](https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/)
- [User Interface Security and the Visibility API](http://w3c.github.io/webappsec-uisecurity/index.html)

=> 4 specifications found

WebIDL continues to evolve. Reffy may incorrectly report as invalid perfectly valid WebIDL content if the specification uses bleeding-edge WebIDL features


## List of specifications with obsolete WebIDL constructs

- [HTML5 Web Messaging](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-webmessaging-20150519/)

=> 1 specification found

A typical example is the use of `[]` instead of `FrozenArray`.

=> 184 inconsistent references for links found in 106 specifications

Links in the body of a specification should be to the same document as that pointed to by the related reference in the References section. The specifications reported here use a different URL. For instance, they may use a link to the Editor's Draft but target the latest published version in the References section. There should be some consistency across the specification.
